        </div>

        <div class= "pure-u-1-3">
            <p> As expected, the majority of Australians are born in Australia. Generally, many Australians 
               are born in England which makes sense due to Australia being colonised by the British in 1788. 
               A lot of Australians are also born in New Zealand due to the geographically close proxmimity of the two countries.
            </p>

            <p>
                When this data was first collected in 1996, most Australians who were born overseas were born in Europe. England, Italy, Greece and Germany 
                are among popular countries of birth. Over time, less Australians born overseas are from Europe. More and more Australians are born in all other
                continents of the world. Of the continents, it appears the more Australians are born in Asia with 655,760 and 845,800 Australians
                being born in China and India respectively.

            <p> Australia is most densely populated in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), this is mostly due to the territory (197.9 persons per square kilometre) being small in area when compared to the rest of the states and territories.
                Victoria (VIC) and New South Wales (NSW) are the next most densely populated states with population densities of 30 and 10.4 persons per square kilometre. 
                The least densely populated state/territory is the Northern Territory with a population density of 0.2 persons per square kilometre.

            <h3> Net Interstate Migration by State</h3>
            <p> <span class = "subtext">Use the legend to highlight a state</span>  </p>
            <div id="int_mig"></div>
            <p>
                Net interstate migration is the departures from a particular state deducted from the total arrivals into that state.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Queensland (QLD) has always had a positive net interstate migration. This means that there has always been more people migrating into Queensland from other states than people migrating out of Queensland.
                Contrastingly, New South Wales (NSW) has always had a negative new interstate migration meaaning there has been more people departing New South Wales than arriving into New South Wales from other states.
                QLD and NSW net interstate migration tend to mirror each other - i.e when net interstate migration is highly positive in QLD, it is highly negative in NSW. From this, it is likely that many residents from NSW 
                are migrating to QLD as the states do neighbor one another.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Northern Territory (NT) and South Australia (SA) have all experienced relatively smooth net interstate migration with mininmal large fluctuations.
                In Western Australia (WA), it is also relatively smooth except for the drop in 2015-2020, then spike up in 2021-2022. As for Victoria (VIC) major downfalls are observable in 1994-1995 and 2021.
                As for 2021, the downfall is most likely attributable to the ongoing lockdowns in VIC due to COVID-19.
