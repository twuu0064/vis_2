                As expected, the <span class = "pBold" > majority of </span>  <span class = "pAus"> Australians</span> <span class = "pBold" > are born in Australia</span> Generally, <span class = "pBold" > many </span> <span class = "pAus">Australians</span> 
                <span class = "pBold" >are born in England </span> makes sense due to Australia being colonised by the British in 1788. 
               A lot of <span class = "pAus"> Australians</span> are also born in New Zealand due to the geographically close proxmimity of the two countries.
            </p>

            <p>
                When this data was first collected in 1996, most <span class = "pAus"> Australians</span>  who were born overseas <span class = "pBold" >were born in Europe </span>. England, Italy, Greece and Germany 
                are among popular countries of birth. Over time, less <span class = "pAus"> Australians</span>  born overseas are from Europe. More and more <span class = "pAus"> Australians</span> are born in all other
                continents of the world. Of the continents, it appears the <span class = "pBold" >more</span> <span class = "pAus"> Australians</span>  <span class = "pBold" >are born in Asia </span> 655,760 and 845,800 <span class = "pAus"> Australians</span> 
                being born in China and India respectively.
            </p>

            <p> 
                What is also evident is that the <span class = "pBold" >proportion of </span><span class = "pAus"> Australians</span> <span class = "pBold" > who were born in Australia is declining.</span> While there was a slight increase in 2021, 
                there is a general declining trend, likely attributable to increasing amounts of overseas migration into Australia.

            <p> Australia is <span class = "pBold" >most densely populated in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT)</span>, this is mostly due to the territory (197.9 persons per square kilometre) being small in area when compared to the rest of the states and territories.
                Victoria (VIC) and New South Wales (NSW) are the next most densely populated states with population densities of 30 and 10.4 persons per square kilometre. 
                The least densely populated state/territory is the Northern Territory with a population density of 0.2 persons per square kilometre.

            <p> Overall, most <span class = "pAus"> Australians</span>  tend to <span class = "pBold" >populate around the coasts of Australia. </span> This is evident in the graph to the left where most of 
                central Australia has a population density of 0. The reason for this is because central Australia is mostly desert and has conditions that

                        Contrastingly, <span class = "pBold" >New South Wales (NSW) has always had a negative new interstate migration. </span>
                        QLD and NSW net interstate migration tend to mirror each other - i.e when net interstate migration is highly positive in QLD, it is highly negative in NSW. From this, it is likely that many residents from NSW 
                        are migrating to QLD as the states do neighbor one another.

                        The Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory and South Australia have all experienced relatively smooth net interstate migration with mininmal large fluctuations.
                        In Western Australia, it is also relatively smooth except for the drop in 2015-2020, then spike up in 2021-2022. As for Victoria major downfalls are observable in 1994-1995 and 2021.
                        As for 2021, the downfall is most likely attributable to the ongoing lockdowns in Victoria due to COVID-19.

                        All states and territories in Australia have faced similar <span class = "pBold" >declining trends in births </span> between 2018 and 2023. The only exception to this is in 
                        2021 where most states saw a spike in births. The increase was not as pronounced in Tasmania, Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, however, this is attributable to
                        these states and territories smaller sizes. The spike in births is perhaps due to COVID-19 and lockdowns that had occurred in 2020.

            <p>

                <span class = "pBold" >Australia's population has gradually grown since the beginning of the 2000s. </span> The only exception to this was between 
                2020 and 2021. As mentioned previously, this was most likely due to COVID-19. Nevertheless, following this dip, in 2022 and 2023 Australia's population 
                continued to grow at a similar rate as in previous years.
            </p>

            <p>
                As shown, there are three scenarios for Australia's projected future population. The high scenario assumes that Australia's population will 
                continue to grow at a similar rate as it has in the past 20 years with Australia's population in 2071 predicted to be 45.89 million people (increase of just over 19 million).
                In the medium scenario the population initally grows at the same rate as in the past 20 years but then gradually slows. In this scenario,
                Australia's population is predicted to be 39.19 million people (increase of under 13 million from 2023). In the low scenario Australia's population growth decreases gradually over time and looks to plateau. In 2071, Australia's 
                population is predicted to be 34.34 million (increase of under 8 million from 2023).
            </p>

            <p>
                How much Australia's population grows will largely <span class = "pBold" >depend on migration rates particularly with conflicts occurring around the world. Furthermore,
                it will also depend on any health events such as COVID-19 as well as cultural changes regarding families. </span> Over time, people have had less children,
                particularly in developed countries such as Australia, as such, it will be interesting to see whether fertility rates continue to decrease or will rise again in future.
